DESCRIPTION:

This software is intended for use by modellers who wish to experiment
with mixing paint (virtually) to match needed colours.  See section
USAGE below for more details.

STATUS:

This software is still under development and is only Alpha standard at
this time.

REQUIREMENTS:

This software requires:
 - Python 2.7 or later
 - PyGTK2 2.24 or later
 - PyCairo 1.8.10 or later

INSTALLATION:

It is NOT necessary to install this software in order to use it.  All
that is necessary for the applications to be usable is for the base
directory to be in the user's PATH environment variable.

USAGE:

This software has a number of components:

1. The Mixer (mcmmtk_palette.py) is a GUI that (once the user
has specified a colour to be matched and selected some paints for use)
enables the modeller to mix paints by specifying the number of "parts"
of each paint to be used in mixing a colour to match the specified
colour.  This mixed colour can then be saved to a list of mixed colours
(along with notes about its intended use).  When the modeller has
finished mixing the colours that the require they may print out a
report to be used as a reference while painting the model for which the
colours were mixed.

2. The Paint Series Editor (mcmmtk_editor.py) is a GUI that enables the
modeller create sets of paintas for use in the mixer.
The recommended method is to produce a "sampler" of the actual paints
to be used on a suitable medium (preferably airbrushed), take a digital
photograph (or scan) and then cut and paste from that photograph into
the tube series editor where its buttons can be used to match the colour.
A Colour Sample Viewer is included as part of the editor. An example
colour sampler file has been added and should be loaded by the viewer
the first time it is launched (and after that it should remember the
last file used).
NB although manufacturer's digital colour charts can be used for a
sample source they are not necessarily accurate as they were produced
with this use in mind and colours are frequently modified to accentuate
the difference between colours.
NB the provided sample is hand painted and should make it clear why an
air brushed version is preferred.

PAINT SERIES:

At this time, the only tube series data included in the distribution is
for an imaginary set of paints known as the "Ideal Paint Colours Series"
which features six colours equally spaced around the colour circle
(at maximim chroma) together with black and white. This series can be
found in the file "ideal.psd" in the "data" subdirectory of the source
distribution and in the directory "$ROOT/share/ModellersColourMatcherMixer/data"
in installed distributions. On Linux $ROOT should be "/usr" and to
facilitate finding the file on Windows the file selector should open in
that directory when the "Paint Series/Open" menu option in the Mixer is
invoked.  Although of no real use in practice this seto of paints is
useful for assessing the Mixer's potential.

INTERNATIONALIZATION:

The code is extensively hooked for i18n but (at the moment) there is no
localization available for languages other than English.
